# Resources Directory

This directory contains supplementary materials for the Cypress testing project. These resources are intended to support learning, provide test scenarios, and offer quick references for development and testing tasks.

## Contents:

-   **`Homework/`**:
    -   This subdirectory includes homework assignments related to learning Cypress, test automation principles, and specific testing techniques. Each assignment may have its own set of instructions and target HTML files (often found in the `htmls` directory).

-   **`LectureCheatSheets/`**:
    -   Contains cheat sheets and concise notes from lectures or workshops. These are designed to be quick references for common Cypress commands, API methods, assertion syntax, and best practices.

-   **`htmls/`**:
    -   A collection of HTML files specifically created for testing purposes. These files provide various UI elements, scenarios, and structures that allow for practicing and demonstrating different Cypress features and selectors.
    -   You can serve these HTML files locally using the `npm run serve` command from the project root, which starts an HTTP server. The files will then be accessible at `http://localhost:8080/Resources/htmls/`.

These resources are valuable for both onboarding new team members and for ongoing reference by the development and QA teams.
