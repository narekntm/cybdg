# 🧪 Cypress Homework – CSS Selectors & UI Interactions

---

## 📚 Objective

You will:
- Practice selecting and interacting with form elements using CSS combinators and pseudo-classes
- Traverse and interact with table rows and action buttons
- Navigate sibling/child relationships in the DOM
- Simulate UI state (e.g., modals) using DOM manipulation
- Use Cypress to validate layout and functionality of a realistic admin dashboard

## 🖼️ HTML Preview

The `homework.html` page contains:

- A sidebar with navigation links
- A user form with inputs, select dropdown, checkbox, and buttons
- A table with 3 users and action buttons
- A hidden modal that can be manually activated for testing

## 🧪 Test Scenarios (in `homework-dashboard.ts`)

### 1. **Fill the User Form**

- ✅ Type a username (`testuser`)
- ✅ Type an email (`testuser@example.com`)
- ✅ Select a role from dropdown (`Editor`)
- ✅ Check the newsletter subscription checkbox
- ✅ Click the Submit button

### 2. **Interact with the User Table**

- ✅ Assert table contains 3 data rows
- ✅ Click “Edit” button on first and second row
- ✅ Assert third row's button is disabled

### 3. **Navigation and Footer Checks**

## 🧠 CSS Selector Types You’ll Use

| Selector Type               | Example                          | Meaning                                  |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Descendant Selector         | `form.user-form .input-group`    | Select element inside a container        |
| Adjacent Sibling            | `label + input`                  | Selects next `<input>` after `<label>`   |
| Child Combinator            | `.actions > .save-btn`           | Direct child of a container              |
| Attribute Selector          | `input[type="checkbox"]`         | Filter input by type                     |
| ID & Class Selectors        | `#edit-modal`, `.primary`        | Select by specific ID or class           |
| Pseudo-classes              | `:checked`, `:disabled`          | Select elements by state                 |
| Positional Selection        | `eq(index)`, `tr:nth-child(n)`   | Select by order/index                    |

## ✅ Test Execution Instructions

1. **Start a local server** from the Cypress project root:

```bash
npx http-server -p 8080
````

2. Open the Cypress UI test runner:

```bash
npx cypress open
```

3. In the Cypress UI:

    * Choose the spec: `homework-dashboard.ts`
    * The test will run against:
      `http://127.0.0.1:8080/Cypress/Tests/UI/Css%20Selectors/htmls/homework.html`

## 📌 Homework Submission Tips

* ✅ Make sure your test passes all assertions
* ✅ Add additional tests if you want extra credit (e.g., error states)
* ✅ Submit both `homework.html` and your `homework-dashboard.ts` file
