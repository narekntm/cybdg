### 📖 **Reading Material**

1. [Cypress + Mocha Docs](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/references/bundled-tools#Mocha)
2. This week's class document: [Lecture 2: L2 Cypress Test Structure with Mocha](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qc5pYE7jnX4RTci3RdcsvdW1a6HUAIQj/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108676864979618001084&rtpof=true&sd=true)

> Instead of actually doing actions with cypress commands, log action descriptions.
> The goal of this homework is just to become familiar with Mocha hooks.

### 💻 **Part 1: Basic Structuring**

#### 🧩 Task: Create a test suite for a Login Page

```text
Scenarios to cover:
- Page loads correctly
- User logs in successfully
- Shows error on wrong credentials
- Prevents login with empty fields
```

**Requirements**:

- Use `describe` and `it` blocks
- Use `beforeEach` to visit the login page before each test
- Use clear, meaningful test names

---

### 💻 **Part 2: Nested Tests with Context**

#### 🧩 Task: Test user roles and dashboard access

```text
User types:
- Guest (cannot access dashboard)
- Regular User (limited features)
- Admin (full access)
```

**Requirements**:

- Use nested `describe`/`context` blocks for each user type
- Use `beforeEach` to simulate login per user
- Use `afterEach` to simulate logout per user
- Test visibility of elements based on role (e.g., settings menu, admin panel)

---

### 💻 **Part 3: Test Reusability**

#### 🧩 Task: Extract shared test behavior

**Example**:

```ts
export const shouldHaveCommonDashboardItems = () => {
  it('shows user avatar', () => { ... });
  it('shows notifications icon', () => { ... });
};
```

- Use this pattern to reuse tests across `User` and `Admin` dashboards
- Import and reuse the shared block from a `sharedTests.ts` file

---

### 📋 **Checklist for Best Practices**

- ✅ Clear test names using `it("should ...")`
- ✅ Hooks are used for setup/teardown only, not assertions
- ✅ All test files follow proper indentation and formatting
- ✅ No `.only()` or `.skip()` committed in final code
- ✅ Use `context` or `describe` for grouping related tests

---

### 📦 **Submission Instructions**

- Push all test files into a `/homework/session-2/` folder
- Include a short `README.md` explaining what each file does
- Submit a GitHub link before the next class
